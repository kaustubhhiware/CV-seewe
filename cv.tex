\section*{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}

  \experiencetwo{Positioning System using Bipartite Matching and Voronoi Diagrams}{Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, under Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay}{May'2016-July'2016}{
   \item Created a positioning module for humanoid robots using computational geometry concepts of Voronoi Cells and Delaunay Triangulations. Also created a role matching module which uses maximum bipartite matching (Hungarian Algorithm) to allot the generated positions to suitable bots dynamically.  
  \item Integrated successfully. Increased the time efficiency of the code
    by 30\% of the previous implementation, using constant memory. 
  \item The team (including me) participated in 3D Simulation League at RoboCup 2016, Germany.
  }
  
  \experiencetwo{Path Planning module for differential drive robots}{Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, under Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay}{May'2015-July'2015}{
  \item Created a path planner for differential drive soccer playing robots 
    using Dynamic Window Algorithm.
  \item Obtained successful results, decreasing the slip parameter to less
    than 1\%.  
  \item The implementation was successfully integrated and the team won the 
    Bronze medal for IIT Kharagpur at FIRA 2015, South Korea.
  }

  \experience{Data extraction from a 2-D plot}{OpenSoft competition, IIT Kharagpur}{Feb'2016-Mar'2016}{
  \item Created a module to extract graph information from a plot and create the corresponding data table using OpenCV libraries and Tesseract.
  \item The implementation was successful in more than 80\% of the cases, including dashed lines and discontinued plots. The extraction module was also used to extract out the legend box from the plot.
  }

  \experience{Line follower robot}{Robotics workshop at IIT Kharagpur}{Dec'2014}{
  \item Attended a workshop organised by IEEE and Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur aimed to create an autonomous line follower robot.
  \item Worked on techniques to build the robot and subsequently, coded the algorithm using DFS traversal to cover the entire grid of lines, using Atmel Studio.
  }

  \experience{Hack the Lab}{Microsoft code.fun.do}{Mar'15}{
  \item   Developed a Windows application along  with a team of 3 to simplify calculations in lab , using best fit line algorithm and stimulating the output on a graph.
  }

  \experience{Department Information System}{Software Project}{Mar'2016}{
  \item Software project under Prof. Partha Pratim Das, IIT Kharagpur .
  \item Created a software in Java which allows users to buy and sell items to different users.
  \item The user can perform administrative roles on his profile and history log, as well as interact with other users through messaging.
  \item Awarded with an "Exceptional" grade in the project work.
  }
